?makemem Medical Officer Research Notebook Page 1 . Trigger at start of game. . The Captain has confided in you about the apparitions. You suspect they are first contact with a new life form! If only you could see one yourself to study… You may have to use your “investigate” ability to look around the ship for ghosts. || Once you find a ghost somewhere, trigger your “Medical Page 2” mem packet.
?makemem Medical Page 2 . Trigger when told to do so. . Fascinating. You’ll need to run some tests. Unfortunately, the Med Bay doesn’t seem to be accessible from where you are. You’ll need to get someone to bring you your **handheld medical scanner**. Once you have it, find a **second** ghost. || Once you find a **second** ghost somewhere, trigger your “Medical Page 3” mem packet.
?makemem Medical Page 3 . Trigger when told to do so. . Well, whatever these apparitions are, they aren’t human. Get the Diplomat to use their “Negotiate” ability on a ghost in the green dimension while you watch. **Tell them to to trigger their “Diplomat 1” mem packet.** OOC NOTE: The Diplomat will not be able to see the ghosts until the second half of game. || If the Diplomat says this is first contact, trigger your “Medical Page 4” mem packet. If the Diplomat says this is **not** first contact, trigger your “Medical Page 5” mem packet.
?makemem Medical Page 4 . Trigger when told to do so. . The readings you took while the Diplomat talked to the ghost don’t agree. I don’t know why your friend would lie to you, but it looks like they did. || After you confront them about this, trigger your “Medical Page 5” mem packet.
?makemem Medical Page 5 . Trigger when told to do so. . You’ll have to go back to the source. Talk to the **Captain** for 2 minutes about the apparitions and when they first started seeing the ghosts. || After you talk to the Captain, trigger your “Medical Page 6” mem packet.
?makemem Medical Page 6 . Trigger when told to do so. . And there’s your answer. So disappointing that it isn’t first contact with a new life form. But ghosts of the dead from the battle for the Captain’s home planet, brought forth as the price for the miracle they pulled off by whatever was in that heirloom amulet the Captain smashed isn’t a terrible consolation prize.
?makemem Diplomat 1 . Trigger when told to do so. . Whatever these are, they aren't a new sentience, so this isn't first contact. You could always lie about it if you feel like being in charge for a while. But can you really do that to your friend? (OOC Note: This use of "negotiate" was free. It does not consume one of your 3 uses; refund yourself the use if necessary).
?makemem Science Officer Research Notebook Page 1 . Trigger at start of game. . Captain has confided in you about the ghosts. You suspect they are **humans from another dimension**.

?makemem Science Page 3 . Trigger when told to do so. . Well, whatever these apparitions are, they aren’t from this time and place. You need help from someone else. Didn’t **Weapons** mention seeing ghosts at some point? Get **Weapons** to use their “Threat assessment” ability on a ghost in the red dimension while you watch. **Tell them to trigger their “Weapons 1” mem packet**.  OOC NOTE: The Weapons officer will not be able to see the ghosts until the second half of game. || If Weapons says they are humans from another dimension, trigger your “Science Page 4” mem packet. If Weapons says they are **not**, trigger your “Science Page 5” mem packet.

?makemem Science Page 6 . Trigger when told to do so. . And there’s your answer. So disappointing that it isn’t humans from a different dimension. But ghosts of the dead from the battle for the Captain’s home planet, brought forth as the price for the miracle they pulled off by whatever was in that heirloom amulet the Captain smashed isn’t a terrible consolation prize.
?makemem Weapons 1 . Trigger when told to do so. . Whatever these are, they aren't humans from another dimension. They look a lot like your nightmares actually. But other people can see them now? They might still be a threat to the ship. You could tell Science that they *are* humans from another dimension, but to what end?
?makemem Navigation Officer Research Notebook Page 1 . Trigger at start of game. . You did it! One of the modifications you made to the engines or the nav must have worked! Well, sort of. You didn’t mean to get the ship stuck like this… So, 2 goals. 1) get some research done before the ship gets fixed. 2) fix the ship so we can survive this. You’ll have to work quickly and try not to get caught! Spend 30 seconds “interacting” with the damaged Navigation System in either the “Black” or “Red” secondary dimension (stay in that channel, don’t engage in activities other than talking - tell people you are investigating the nav system). OOC WARNING: You will not be able to complete this research notebook if you do not investigate the damaged Nav system in one of the secondary dimensions before it is repaired!! || Once you are done interacting with the damaged navigation systems, trigger your “Navigation Page 2” mem packet.
?makemem Navigation Page 2 . Trigger when told to do so. . Interesting. Normal Jump Navigation requires spherical polar coordinates. You had added a multiplication factor to each coordinate that you thought would direct the ship to the equivalent location in a different dimension. It looks like something is missing though…  - Check the scanners in one of the **primary** dimensions (Y, C, M), and the scanners in one of the **secondary** dimensions (R, G, Bl, Bk) by spending 30 seconds “interacting” with the scanners (stay in that channel, don’t engage in activities other than talking, tell people you are reviewing the scanner outputs). This will allow you to compare the positioning readings and figure out what was missing in the coordinates you input originally. || Once you are done interacting with the scanners, trigger your “Navigation Page 3” mem packet.
?makemem Navigation Page 3 . Trigger when told to do so. . Carry the 3… take the arcsine… And there you have it - along with the multiplication factor, you need to include an intercept as well, otherwise the ship doesn’t move completely into the new dimension! Now all you need to do is figure out what numbers you could input as an intercept that correspond to actual other dimensions. You shudder to think what it would mean to “jump” to the space between dimensions. - Once the Nav system is fixed, repeat your “investigation” (30 seconds in that channel, not doing anything else, tell people you are investigating the nav system). ||  Once you are done interacting with the repaired navigation system, trigger your “Navigation Page 4” mem packet.
?makemem Navigation Page 4 . Trigger when told to do so. . And there we go, with the data from the scanners in the two dimensions, and the spherical polar coordinates from the modified and restored nav system, you can deduce a series of likely intercept numbers that *should* correspond to other dimensions!!
?makemem Threat Assessment 1 . Trigger when told to do so by a sign. . If this isn’t repaired, one of the primary dimensions that overlap to create this secondary dimension won’t re-integrate correctly, and anyone left in that primary dimension won’t survive. The primary dimension that won’t re-integrate will be the one with the fewest people in it. You are not sure that the TMF Hope carries enough supplies to repair everything that needs repair. It may not be possible to save everyone.

?makemem Broom Closet . Open when told to do so by a sign. . There is a ghostly figure dressed as a captain, inside an emergency space suit. It is torn in several places. They say “You take the last life pod. A good captain goes down with their ship”. They do not respond to you no matter what you try.
?makemem Lab Bench . Open when told to do so by a sign. . There is a ghostly figure hiding under the bench, covering their heads and muttering about how they should have been a doctor. As you watch, they are consumed by an explosion.
?makemem Patient Bay . Open when told to do so by a sign. . There is a ghostly figure lying unconscious on the bed in the ward. Their injuries are terrible and consistent with severe shrapnel damage. They do not respond to you no matter what you do.
?makemem Kitchen . Open when told to do so by a sign. . There is a ghostly figure huddled in the corner sobbing about lost comrades. Their pearly, translucent skin is covered with cuts and bruises. They do not respond to you no matter what you do.
?makemem Weight Room . Open when told to do so by a sign. . There is a ghostly figure swearing and frantically trying to repair something you can’t see. They curse and grab a ghostly fire extinguisher. The scene loops back to the beginning.
?makemem Theater . Open when told to do so by a sign. . A ghostly body in a space suit floats in vacuum, surrounded by debris. You can’t tell if they are unconscious or dead, but the hold in their section of the ship must have been breached by something. They do not respond to you no matter what you do.
?makemem Crates . Open when told to do so by a sign. . A pair of ghostly figures scramble to load missiles into the missile bays. They hit the ready button, and look at each other with haunted eyes. The scene loops back to the beginning.
?makemem Half Way There . Open after 1 hour has passed in game. . Set your Alpha score to 1. If it was already at 1, do not change it. Tell other players you encounter to open their "Half Way There" packet.
?makemem Ship Repairs . Open if you repair or help repair any part of the ship. . This is bad. Someone messed with the ship's systems, changing them to who knows what purpose. But the evidence that the systems were deliberately altered is plain to you as an expert mechanic. No wonder the jump failed. But who? and why?
