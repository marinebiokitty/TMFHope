(The Engineering ability will explain how to execute the repair.) If you fix this engine: a) consume "a large metal plate" and "patching putty" items, b) switch this sign with the sign named “Cafeteria Engines Access: Repaired”, c) start a five-minute cooldown timer for the welding torch, and d) if anyone working on the repairs has one, they should trigger their "Ship Repairs" mem packet.  If you hand off the welding torch to someone else before it cools, have them start a timer for whatever time was left in the cooldown (and tell them to do the same if they pass it off).
