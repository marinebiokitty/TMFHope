\name{\cEng{}}

You grew up on ships. Your parents were ship's engineers. You learned to fix ships almost before you could walk. You've worked on \pNew{} almost your entire adult life. In many ways, she's your baby. You are the crew-member who has served aboard her for the longest. \cCap{} is your third captain.

You are, unsurprisingly, also the oldest member of the crew. Old enough that your body aches in the morning, and your eyesight is going. For several years you were able to conceal the matter with contacts, and then glasses, but now you are bordering on blind. You are terrified of \cCap{} or even worse, \cXO{} finding out - you'd surely be dismissed from the crew. \cWeap{} is also a problem, always trying to stick \cWeap{\their} nose where it doesn't belong. You have to regularly throw \cWeap{\them} out of the engine room.

It was a stroke of luck meeting \cBoy{} at the last port of call. \cBoy{\They} seem\cBoy{\plural} to have a natural talent for taking care of the \pNew{}. \cBoy{} reminds you of yourself when you were younger. You immediately went to \cCap{} and requested to add \cBoy{} to the crew.

\cCap{} was surprisingly easy to convince. You suspect it had to do with \cNav{} advocating for the same thing. You suppose you should be grateful to \cNav{\them} for that. But that's as far as your gratitude extends. \cNav{} is always talking about jump tech, and insinuating that \pNew{} could do so much more than she is already doing. Even if managing jumps weren't the navigator's job, you'd still suspect \cNav{} of being at fault for the current mess.

Your poor ship. She's trapped between dimensions or something, and it is tearing her apart. You've got to fix her, no matter what.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Fix the \pNew{}, no matter what.
	\item Figure out who caused this botched jump and make sure they can't do it again.
	\item Teach \cBoy{} how to be a good engineer.
	\item Don't let anyone figure out that your eyesight is going.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You start game in the Med Bay in the ``Magenta'' dimension. You also have access to the Cafeteria in the ``Blue'' dimension.
	\item The two dimensions you can access {\em feel} different somehow -- magenta feels purer, more primary, while blue feels half-real, halfway between other dimensions, more secondary.  Is that how everyone else feels?
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cBoy{}} Space is hard enough for those who grew up in it. \cBoy{} grew up station side. You've been helping \cBoy{\them} learn the ropes.
	\contact{\cWeap{}} \cWeap{} is nosy, and you are worried \cWeap{\they} will discover your eyesight is failing.
	\contact{\cNav{}} \cNav{\They} \Nav{\are} the newest crew-member (aside from \cBoy{}). Your ship never failed a jump before \cNav{\they} came aboard. The navigator is in charge of jumps. This is \cNav{\their} fault, you just have to prove it.
